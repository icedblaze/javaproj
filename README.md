This code is an inventory management system where i have used the fundamental concepts ofobject oriented programming such as
-inheritance
-exception handling
-declaration of classes and objects
-polymorphism
and more.
I have used the netbeans java IDE to create the graphical user interface of my inventory management system.
In order to view my project itis important to install netbeans and have acess to phpMyadmin(sqldatabase)
The source code can be run by just pressing the run button(the gui will automatically be generated and the respective functions can be performed)
